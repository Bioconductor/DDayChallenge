# DDayChallenge

This is a simple package containing get-to-know-you challenges related
to robust, efficient, and scalable R code. Working in informal teams,
the goal is to improve the code inside this package. Your team will:

1. Get everyone up to speed on the basics of github -- the team must
   make a clone of this package into at least one member's github
   account.

2. Tackle individual problems. Start with the problems in 'robust.R',
   then efficient.R.
   
3. In the process, use roxygen2-style documentation,
   devtools::document(), and devtools::check() to make sure that the
   package remains correct.
   
4. Work on this, and get to know your fellow developers, during the
   alotted time this morning; revisit when bored. Use these as
   templates for thinking about other presentations during the
   conference.
